# SubQuery - CORD 

## Preparation

#### Environment

- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) are required to compile project and define types.

- Both SubQuery CLI and generated Project have dependencies and require [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/).

## Configure your project

In the starter package, we have provided a simple example of project configuration. You will be mainly working on the following files:

- The Manifest in `project.yaml`
- The GraphQL Schema in `schema.graphql`
- The Mapping functions in `src/mappings/` directory

For more information on how to write the SubQuery,
check out our doc section on [Define the SubQuery](https://doc.subquery.network/define_a_subquery.html)

#### Code generation

In order to index your SubQuery project, it is mandatory to build your project first.
Run this command under the project directory.

```
yarn codegen
```

## Build the project

In order to deploy your SubQuery project to our hosted service, it is mandatory to pack your configuration before upload.
Run pack command from root directory of your project will automatically generate a `your-project-name.tgz` file.

```
yarn build
```

## Indexing and Query

#### Run required systems in docker

Under the project directory run following command:

```
docker-compose pull && docker-compose up
```

#### Query the project

Open your browser and head to `http://localhost:3000`.

Finally, you should see a GraphQL playground is showing in the explorer and the schemas that ready to query.

For the `cord-subql` project, you can try to query with the following code to get a taste of how it works.

run the 'yarn demo' from cord.js repo, and see that below query would provide the results.

```graphql
{
 blocks {
    totalCount
  },
  extrinsics {
    totalCount
    nodes {
      id
      section
      method
    }
  },
  events {
    totalCount
    nodes{
      id
      section
      method
      blockNumber
      timestamp
      index
    }
  }
}
```
